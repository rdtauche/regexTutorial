Regex tutorial on matching email

## Introduction

My assignment this week is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. A template was provided by the bootcamp CU team in the starter code to create my walkthrough.

## User Story

```
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```

## Installation

    1. The code to deploy is stored at this Github location:  https://github.com/rdtauche/regexTutorial
